Google Homepage Re-Creation

About the Project

This is my first project as part of the Odin Project Web Development curriculum. In this project I have attempted to recreate the Google homepage based on the basic HTML and CSS I have learned, and with the help of W3Schools, stackoverflow, Google search and developper tools.

What I've learned

On completion of this project, I've learned to use Google search effectively, get comfortable with experimenting, and how to navigate the developper tools efficiently (as a last resort). I've also become a lot more comfortable using Git. While the page is not perfect, I am very happy with the result!
